#' Filtering Life Events by Age and Influence
#'
#' \code{filter_le} filters life events by a specified age and influence at
#' time of interview. By default life events occuring at the same age year as
#' the specified age filter are kept. Life events passing the filteres are
#' indicated by 1 and are otherwise 0.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing the life events data
#' @param age.filter A logical. If age.filter = T, life events will be filtered
#' according to the max.age and include.last.year settings. Missing age information
#' will set life event to missing.
#' @param max.age A string. Name of the column with the maximum allowable age. Since
#' the age at which a life event happened is only available at whole years,
#' this by default can also include events, which happened after the allowable
#' age, if include.last.year = T.
#' @param include.last.year A logical. If TRUE, life events occuring at the
#' same age as "max.age" are kept. Thus some events might have happened after
#' "max.age". If FALSE, life events occuring at the same age will be set as not
#' having occured. Default is TRUE.
#' @param influence.filter A logical. If influence.filter = T, life events will
#' be filtered according to the min.influence setting. Missing influence
#' information will set life events to missing.
#' @param  min.influence A numeric value. The minimum amount of influence
#' at the time of interview.
#' \enumerate{
#'  \item 'no influence / geen'
#'  \item 'a little influence / een beetje'
#'  \item 'moderate influence / tamelijk veel'
#'  \item 'a lot of influence / heel veel'
#' }
#' @param reliable A logical. Indicates whether life events should be omitted,
#' when they were judged to be unreliable, e.g. when language difficulties
#' were noted during the interview. reliable = T omits unreliable life events,
#' reliable = F keeps them. Missing reliability information is assumed to
#' be reliable.
#' @return A matrix containing information whether life events occured (1)
#' or not (0).
